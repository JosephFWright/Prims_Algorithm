 Class Project
 
      Final Project for Discrete Mathematics
       - Takes input of user choice at Menu
       - Takes input of a weighted graph.txt file*
       - Takes an input of starting node vertex
       - Takes input on choice to display graph
       - Begins forming MST using Prim's algorithm
       - Result: Gives total weight of edges for MST.

*Each line is formated as: Node_1 Node_2 Edge_weight
